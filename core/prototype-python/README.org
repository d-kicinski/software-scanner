* Task
  I want to detect and localize a white flat rectangular object.(eg document, recip, piece of paper,
  qr code). Ideally it should be efiicient enough so that it allow to perform real time detection on
  the smartphone.

* Steps
** TODO Localize object
   I think this could be done using just edge detection, but probably it won't be enough rebust to
   randoms.

*** First approach   
1. Convert to gray scale

3. Applay Gaussian Blur
   Reduces noises(eg textures) so edge detection should perform better.

5. Applay morphological transform to recognize white on white


   
** TODO Extract the white space
   The main problem will be guess which rectangular object is the actual wanted one. Later a
   perspetive transform will give nice extraction.

** TODO Extract the sth on paper ??
   What is:
   + morphological operation
   + thresholding
